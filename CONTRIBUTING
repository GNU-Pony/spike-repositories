It is preferable if you GPG-sign your commits and request a pull
to https://github.com/GNU-Pony/info/tree/master/openpgp-keys for
inclusion of your key.


How to create a GPG-key:
Open your terminal and run:
    gpg --gen-key
Export your key by running:
    gpg --armour --export (your key*) > (your username).asc

* something that uniquely identifies your key, it can be
  its ID, your name, your e-mail, et c.


To do a git commit with GPG-signing and off signing you use the
command:  git commit --gpg-sign=(your GPG key ID) --signoff


A suggestion on how to remember to sign your commit:

In my bashrc I have a function named ‘gitcom’ with
is:  git commit --signoff -m "$*"
If signs off the commit and I just need to have
the message after ‘gitcom’ and id can be multiple
arguments.

But when I am in this repository it is instead:
git commit --gpg-sign=(my GPG key) --signoff -m "$*"

This modification is done automatically be cause my
‘gitcom’ function actually looks like this:

function gitcom
{
    local d="$(pwd)" sd="(THE PATH TO THIS REPOSITORY)"
    if [ "${d}" = "${sd}" ] || [ "${d::(LENGTH OF sd)}" = "${sd}/" ]
    then
        git commit --gpg-sign=(MY GPG KEY) --signoff -m "$*"
    else
        git commit --signoff -m "$*"
    fi
}



Pull requests can be set to maandree@member.fsf.org if you
do not have a github account that can use GitHub's facility
for requesting pulls. If so, please format the subject line
like this: `Spike %repo: %scroll`. Urgent patches, such as
security patches, should be sent with highest priority and
wthe the subject line formated `[URGENT] Spike: %scroll (%repo)`
so that I quikly see that it is important. Please also send
I message with the subjectly formated like that if you have
made an urgent pull request on GitHub.

If you find yourself making many pull requests or if you
are maintaining a package that is often patch for security,
request collaboration access to Spike-repositories (especially
in the latter case.)
