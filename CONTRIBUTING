It is preferable if you GPG-sign your commits and request a pull
to https://github.com/GNU-Pony/info/tree/master/openpgp-keys for
inclusion of your key.


How to create a GPG-key:
Open your terminal and run:
    gpg --gen-key
Export your key by running:
    gpg --armour --export (your key*) > (your username).asc

* something that uniquely identifies your key, it can be
  its ID, your name, your e-mail, et c.


To do a git commit with GPG-signing and off signing you use to
command:  git commit --gpg-sign=(your GPG key ID) --signoff


A suggestion on how to remember to sign your commit:

In my bashrc I have a function named ‘gitcom’ with
is:  git commit --signoff -m "$*"
If signs off the commit and I just need to have
the message after ‘gitcom’ and id can be multiple
arguments.

But when I am in this repository it is instead:
git commit --gpg-sign=(my GPG key) --signoff -m "$*"

This modification is done automatically be cause my
‘gitcom’ function actually looks like this:

function gitcom
{
    local d="$(pwd)" sd="(THE PATH TO THIS REPOSITORY)"
    if [ "${d}" = "${sd}" ] || [ "${d::(LENGTH OF sd)}" = "${sd}/" ]
    then
        git commit --gpg-sign=(MY GPG KEY) --signoff -m "$*"
    else
        git commit --signoff -m "$*"
    fi
}
