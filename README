Spike repositories maintainer utilities.

You can create a directory named _ inside
any directory it will be ignored by Git.

Use _ in the top directory for temporary
files. Create the directories _have_ and
_need_ inside _. You can copy the script
you want to using into _ so that they do
not disappear when you checkout another
branch.


deps-extract will print all existing
dependencies in the checkout branch,
inside the current working directory. No
version range is printed, just the name
of the required package. Each line in
the output start with _need_. If your
working directory is _ in the top
directory, you can type
`./deps-extract .. | xargs touch`,
when you have verified that nothing is
weird in the output of `./deps-extract ..`.

provides-extract works in the same
way as `deps-extract`, except it uses
_have_ rather than _need_ and prints
all existing packages, what they are
variants of and which packages they
provide.

After running deps-extract and
provides-extract for each of the
branches core, extra and more you can
run `./remaining`, this will print
the names of all package that are
dependencies for any package in the
package repository but is not in the
package repository itself.

deps-extract and provides-extract
can be invoked with the environment
variable DEBUG set to anything that
is not an empty string (or just
containing NUL:s). If this is done
the packages will be printed directly
after the scroll they are found in,
rather than after all scrolls, but
the output will not bit fitted for
use with `xargs touch`.
